**Existential Casino / Gambling Depression Simulator** · Solana 2025

“There is no escape. Only the loop.”

## The Game
You spawn in a flickering fluorescent corridor.  
Two doors. One question forever:

**Eat or Gambol?**

- Gambol → press the sacred lingam → 10 / 100 / 1,000 / 10,000 / 100,000 $GAMBOL per flip  
- Eat → 10 / 100 / 1,000 / 10,000 / 100,000 $GAMBOL per burger
- after a strike of wins (occasionally) you are prompted differet stuff like
  - Sex → 100 $GAMBOL 15 sec of black screen + audio moans  
  - Lambo → 1,000 $GAMBOL for a ride  (like in a easy rally game, just one loop)
  - Rolex → 100,000 $GAMBOL permanent wrist cope
- Broke → Go home or Kitchen of Despair (here you will spend time doing stupid tasks like cut cucumbers to earn some $EOG to continue gambling, money from sold Burgers)
- Touch Grass → to exit

## Tokenomics – $EOG
- Total supply: 1,000,000,000 (9 decimals)  
- Launch: pump.fun fair launch  
- Taxes: 0%

### Pyments
- trying 402 protocol

#### Revenue (all on-chain)
Flip (2% house edge):
- 1.8% → immortal house vault  
- 0.2% → dev wallet

Burger:
- 20% burned forever  
- 80% → wage pool for the kitchen slaves  
- 0.2% → dev wallet

##### Casino That Cannot Die
Fixed tiers + house vault ≥ 400× current max bet → probability of ruin = 0.

###### Memories of the Loop – 100,000 Possible 1/1 NFTs
When you finally Touch Grass (don't rage-quit!!!), the game instantly mints your unique **Memories of the Loop** NFT:

- 10 different characters (Pepe, Doge, Wojak, KABUTO, Frieren, etc.)  
- 8–10 locations (lingam room, burger counter, sex booth, Lambo loop, kitchen, corridor, etc.)  
- Random pose / expression / lighting  
- Traits burned on-chain that can be shown:  
  → Rolex owned?  
  → Lambo rides count  
  → Times had sex  
  → Biggest win streak  
  → Hours worked in kitchen  

Total combinations ≈ 100,000+ unique 1/1s.  
If your exact combo is already minted → next available unminted one.  
Collection mints until sold out, then stops forever.

Your despair, immortalised as art.  
Trade it on Tensor / MagicEden for SOL.

## Roadmap
- Now → devnet  
- Soon → mainnet + pump.fun  
- Later → 3D corridor, full kitchen, 100k NFT drop  
- Never → an exit
